## Overview

My personal dotfiles. The whole thing leans on three ideas: keep it minimal, keep it consistent, and make every tool look like it belongs to the same family. What's here:

- Brew dependencies (apps, fonts, LSPs) in [`Brewfile`](Brewfile)
- Apps and tools config in [`dotfiles/.config/`](dotfiles/.config)
- [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) setup, `settings.json` and statusline, in [`dotfiles/.claude/`](dotfiles/.claude) (global rules sync via Kasetto, see below)
- Git, SSH, GPG in [`.gitconfig`](dotfiles/.gitconfig), [`.ssh/`](dotfiles/.ssh), [`.gnupg/`](dotfiles/.gnupg)

## Main Principles

- Minimalism, consistency, simplicity
- One unified look via [pivoshenko.theme](https://github.com/pivoshenko/pivoshenko.theme). Right now I'm running **Popil** (warm ash, muted terracotta). **Morok** (pitch black, cool accents) and **Vatra** (Carpathian hearth, gruvbox-warm) are vendored alongside it
- [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono), everywhere

To switch flavors: `just set-flavor <morok|popil|vatra>`, then `just dotfiles`.

## Installation

Everything is managed with [dotdrop](https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop) and driven through [just](https://github.com/casey/just).

1. Fork and clone this repository
2. Install everything:

```shell
just install
```

That runs `brew bundle`, deploys both dotdrop profiles, bootstraps Fisher and the fish plugins, builds the `bat` theme cache, links the vault, and reinstalls the herdr hook and plugins. Need only one part? Every step is its own recipe - run `just` on its own to see them.

Three files stay untracked and have to be created by hand on a new machine:

- `~/.gitconfig.local` - your `[user]` block. [`.gitconfig`](dotfiles/.gitconfig) sets `useConfigOnly = true`, so git refuses to commit until this exists. Commits are GPG-signed, so it also needs `signingkey = <your key id>`
- `~/.config/fish/local.fish` - anything shell-related that is specific to this machine
- `~/.config/fish/.secrets.fish` - tokens and keys

> [!NOTE]
> A few things still want a manual step, because the app owns its own settings store rather than reading a file: **Telegram** and **Discord** (theme installs through the app's UI), **Obsidian** (theme picked in appearance settings), and **Stylus** and **Rectangle** (import the exported JSON). The relevant sections below spell out what to do.

## Terminal - Ghostty

[Ghostty](https://ghostty.org) is a fast, GPU-accelerated, native macOS terminal from Mitchell Hashimoto. It's the first terminal in years that feels designed rather than accreted. No perceptible latency, and a config format that reads cleanly. Config: [`dotfiles/.config/ghostty`](dotfiles/.config/ghostty).

## Shell - Fish

[Fish](https://fishshell.com) comes with the good stuff already on: autosuggestions, syntax highlighting, and scripting that doesn't drag along bash's compatibility baggage. I run it with a handful of plugins through [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher). Config: [`dotfiles/.config/fish`](dotfiles/.config/fish).

Prompt is [Starship](https://starship.rs): one binary, one TOML file, works in every shell, and fast enough that I stop noticing it. Config: [`dotfiles/.config/starship.toml`](dotfiles/.config/starship.toml).

### CLI Tools

The tools I reach for every day, all configured under [`.config/`](dotfiles/.config):

- [Bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) - `cat` with syntax highlighting and git gutters. Hard to go back once you've used it
- [Bottom](https://github.com/ClementTsang/bottom) - `htop` rethought: keyboard-driven, themable, readable on a wide monitor
- [Delta](https://github.com/dandavison/delta) - makes `git diff` pleasant to read instead of a squinting exercise
- [Eza](https://github.com/eza-community/eza) - a modern `ls` with icons, git status, and a tree mode that handles big repositories fine
- [Fastfetch](https://github.com/fastfetch-cli/fastfetch) - fast, configurable, JSONC-driven system fetch
- [Fd](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd) - `find` with sane defaults and far less typing
- [Fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) - fuzzy-finds everything and plugs into everything. If I could keep one CLI tool, this is it
- [Ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) - very fast grep that respects `.gitignore` out of the box
- [K9s](https://github.com/derailed/k9s) - a Kubernetes UI that keeps me out of `kubectl get pods | grep`
- [LazyGit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit) - staging, rebases, and cherry-picks at TUI speed. It replaced every GUI git client I used to run
- [LazyDocker](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazydocker) - the same idea as LazyGit, pointed at containers and compose stacks
- [Zoxide](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) - a smarter `cd` that learns the directories you actually use. Type `z foo` and you're there

The full list of installed CLI tools is in the [`Brewfile`](Brewfile).

## Editors

### Editor - Helix

[Helix](https://helix-editor.com) is my primary CLI editor, and I keep moving more day-to-day work into it. Its selection-first modal model (selection then action, à la Kakoune) clicked for me in a way Vim's verb-object grammar never quite did. Multiple cursors and tree-sitter selections feel native rather than bolted on, and LSP works without a plugin scavenger hunt. Config: [`dotfiles/.config/helix`](dotfiles/.config/helix).

### Editor - Zed

[Zed](https://zed.dev) is my daily editor. It's Rust-native, GPU-accelerated, and collaborative, and it ships Vim, Helix, and Whichkey modes in the box instead of leaving them to third-party plugins. Config: [`dotfiles/.config/zed/settings.json`](dotfiles/.config/zed/settings.json).

## Agentic Coding

### Agent - Claude Code

[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) is my coding assistant. Config (`settings.json` plus a custom statusline): [`dotfiles/.claude`](dotfiles/.claude).

Skills, MCPs, and instructions (the global `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` rules) are distributed across hosts with [Kasetto](https://kasetto.dev/). The Kasetto config lives in [`pivoshenko/pivoshenko.ai`](https://github.com/pivoshenko/pivoshenko.ai), with personal and external sources both included.

The global rules used to be a single `CLAUDE.md` in this repository. They now live as individual instruction files in [`pivoshenko.ai/instructions`](https://github.com/pivoshenko/pivoshenko.ai/tree/main/instructions), with a structure loosely inspired by *Andrej Karpathy's CLAUDE.md*.

### Agent Runtime - Herdr

[Herdr](https://herdr.dev) is the daemon my agents run on. It keeps real terminal sessions open in the background, so a long task survives the lid closing or the network dropping and is still there when I come back. It drives several agents across workspaces at once and shows at a glance which ones are working, blocked, or idle.

Config: [`dotfiles/.config/herdr/config.toml`](dotfiles/.config/herdr/config.toml). Only the config file is managed, since the rest of `~/.config/herdr` holds sockets, logs, and session state.

Plugins are listed one per line in [`herdr.plugins`](herdr.plugins), the same way Fisher tracks fish plugins in `fish_plugins`. `just herdr-plugins` reads that file and installs each entry, so adding a plugin means adding a line rather than editing a recipe. The plugins themselves install into `~/.config/herdr/plugins` and stay untracked; their key bindings live in the managed `config.toml`.

## macOS

### Hotkeys Daemon - Karabiner

I drive as much as I can from the keyboard, with Vi/Kakoune motions. Where macOS or the window manager won't cooperate, [Karabiner](https://github.com/pqrs-org/Karabiner-Elements) covers the gap. It's built around [home row mods](https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods), following this [guide](https://havn.blog/2024/03/03/a-good-way.html).

Config: [`dotfiles/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json`](dotfiles/.config/karabiner/karabiner.json).

### Tiling Window Manager - Rectangle

[Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/) gives me i3-style tiling on macOS. I tried yabai and Aerospace first; Rectangle won on the boring but decisive point of surviving every macOS update without any SIP gymnastics. Config: [`dotfiles/.config/rectangle/config.json`](dotfiles/.config/rectangle/config.json). Rectangle keeps its live settings in its own preferences plist, so this file is an export - import it from *Preferences -> ... -> Import*, the same way the Stylus and Telegram themes go in.

## Browser - Zen

[Zen](https://zen-browser.app) is a Firefox fork that ships the browser experience I'd been hand-rolling with userChrome hacks for years: keyboard-driven, vertical tabs, minimal chrome. Extensions:

- [Custom New Tab](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/custom-new-tab-page) - sends new tabs to my own [startpage](https://startpage.pivoshenko.dev) instead of Mozilla's default
- [DuckDuckGo](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-for-firefox) - my default search
- [MetaMask](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ether-metamask) - Ethereum/EVM wallet, the one every dapp assumes you already have
- [NordPass](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nordpass-password-management) - password manager I've stuck with for years; the autofill stays out of the way
- [NordVPN](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nordvpn-proxy-extension) - same family, same story
- [Obsidian Web Clipper](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/web-clipper-obsidian) - clips articles straight into the vault as clean Markdown, no copy-paste dance
- [Phantom](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/phantom-app) - Solana-first multichain wallet; cleaner UX than MetaMask when I'm off EVM
- [Privacy Badger](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/privacy-badger17) - EFF's heuristic tracker blocker, which pairs well with uBlock without stepping on it
- [RaindropIo](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/raindropio) - bookmarks with tags, collections, and a UI I don't mind opening
- [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us) - userstyles, minus the abandonware history of Stylish
- [uBlock](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin) - the ad blocker. Thank you, Raymond Hill
- [Vimium](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vimium-ff) - keyboard navigation on every page; once `f` follows a link for you, the mouse feels slow

`userChrome.css` / `userContent.css` live in [`dotfiles/.config/zen`](dotfiles/.config/zen) and deploy into the active profile's [`chrome/` subfolder](https://www.userchrome.org).

Per-site styling is handled by [Stylus](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/styl-us). The userstyles export to [`dotfiles/.config/stylus`](dotfiles/.config/stylus) and get imported through the extension's preferences.

## Notes - Obsidian

I keep my notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md): local-first, plain Markdown on disk, no lock-in, and a plugin ecosystem that covers what I'd otherwise reach for Notion for. The vault syncs over iCloud. Vendored themes and snippets in [`dotfiles/.config/obsidian`](dotfiles/.config/obsidian) deploy via the `me` profile into `<vault>/.obsidian/{themes,snippets}/`; the vault path is machine-specific and set in [`dotdrop.config.yaml`](dotdrop.config.yaml). The active theme is chosen inside Obsidian's appearance settings.

Plugins:

- [Obsidian Admonition](https://github.com/javalent/admonitions) - styled callout blocks (notes, warnings, tips) that still save as plain Markdown
- [Obsidian Images in-editor](https://github.com/ozntel/oz-image-in-editor-obsidian) - inline image previews in source mode, so I stop flipping to preview
- [Obsidian Tag Wrangler](https://github.com/pjeby/tag-wrangler) - rename and merge tags without a grep-and-replace across the vault
- [Obsidian Outliner](https://github.com/vslinko/obsidian-outliner) - bullet handling that behaves like Workflowy or Roam
- [Obsidian Style Settings](https://github.com/mgmeyers/obsidian-style-settings) - surfaces theme variables in the UI so I'm not editing CSS to change an accent

## Music - Spotify

Spotify is customized through [Spicetify](https://github.com/spicetify/cli). Themes live in [`dotfiles/.config/spicetify/Themes`](dotfiles/.config/spicetify/Themes); activate a flavor with `just spicetify <morok|popil|vatra>`.

## Messengers

### Messenger - Telegram

[Telegram](https://telegram.org) with my Popil theme, installed from [t.me/addtheme/pivoshenko_theme_popil](https://t.me/addtheme/pivoshenko_theme_popil).

### Messenger - Discord

The official Discord client is missing too much for me, so I run [Vesktop](https://github.com/Vencord/Vesktop) instead. Install the Popil theme through *Themes -> Online Themes*:

```css
@dark https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pivoshenko/pivoshenko.theme/refs/heads/main/dist/discord/popil.theme.css
```

## Other Apps

- [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com) - warms the display after sunset; I notice right away on a machine that doesn't have it
- [NordPass](https://nordpass.com) / [NordVPN](https://nordvpn.com) - a password manager and a VPN I've run for years without having to think about either. That's the whole point
- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io) - one client for every database I touch. The Eclipse bones are ugly, but it handles Postgres, MySQL, SQLite, and Mongo without me hunting down a vendor GUI for each
- [Redis Insight](https://redis.io/insight) - the one exception to DBeaver: Redis's own GUI reads streams, keyspaces, and memory in a way a generic SQL client never quite matches
- [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) - WireGuard with the setup pain removed. My NAS, work boxes, and phone all sit on one flat network, and I haven't touched VPN config in years
- [Maccy](https://maccy.app) - clipboard-history manager: lightweight, keyboard-driven, and out of the way until I hit the hotkey
- [Logi Options+](https://www.logitech.com/software/logi-options-plus.html) - per-app buttons and gestures for the Logitech mouse, which is what finally makes the extra thumb buttons worth having
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) - the container runtime everything else assumes; LazyDocker just drives what it provides
